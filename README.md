Hi, I’m Arda 👋  

I’m an MSc Artificial Intelligence student at KTU, curious about how machine learning
ideas turn into real systems.
I mostly work with Deep Learning and Computer Vision, focusing on practical,
hands-on projects rather than isolated experiments.

I enjoy learning by building, breaking things, and improving them until they work
in a real-world setting.
